The PHP could of course use classes and the like, this is far from clean.

All variables are defined in the $sprint array.
* number:         number of the current sprint (could be called sprintID);
* days:           amount of days in the sprint;
* points:         total number of points for Tasks commited to during the sprint;
* USPoints:       total number of points for User Stories in the sprint;
* dailyPoints:    array to be updated daily, based on the number of tasks points burned in the previous day;
* dailyUSPoints:  array to be updated daily, based on the number of points for User Stories finished the previous day;
* dailyBugs:      array to be updated daily, based on the time spent on bugs during the previous day.

Two projections are displaying the following:
* a global projection: sprint status based on the average points burned since the start of the sprint;
* a local projection:  sprint status based on the points burned during the last day.
